# Fixed-Pixel-Place-Painter
I fixed a pixelplace painter that was made by @equbuxu credits to him and its really easy to setup
first of all u need visual studio 2022 to run it since i couldnt fix it with other apps
2nd u just click run and thats all
u may need a license key with the generated computer id thats urs
if it doesnt work make sure to send it in the error thing
